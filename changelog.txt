Version: 1.1.7
Date: 2025.08.03
  Bugfixes:
    - Changed the default key binding for opening the calculator to ALT + X so that it won't
      conflict with the default keybinding for copper wire anymore.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.6
Date: 2025.02.15
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash triggered by recipes that have "research-progress" as a product.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.5
Date: 2024.12.02
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a rare timing crash triggered when the game saves while the calculator still has
      backlogged computations to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.4
Date: 2024.10.26
  Minor Features:
    - Hovering over a recipe choosing button now displays the selected recipe's tooltip.
    - Added quality to the tracked module effects.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.3
Date: 2024.10.22
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash triggered by recipes which could only be crafted manually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
Date: 2024.10.22
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash triggered on game configuration change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.1
Date: 2024.10.21
  Info:
    - Updated to Factorio 2.0.
    - Temporarily disabled module filtering.
    - Quality modules not yet supported.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2024.10.21
  Major Features:
    - Added the ability to solve "complex" recipe systems. Limitations:
      1) The calculator will show an error message whenever a unique solution does not exist.
      2) The calculator now requires that each involved product be assigned a unique recipe, and
      that each used recipe is associated to a unique product. Selecting recipes in the correct
      order is therefore required to handle complex recipe systems.
  Minor Features:
    - Sheets can now have multiple final products set.
    - Removed "Totals" section, as its functionality can now be achieved by setting all final
      products in one sheet.
    - Changed crafting machine selection to be unique per recipe, instead of unique per crafting
      category, as this caused some annoying behavior with some mods.
  Optimizations:
    - The calculator now uses Sparse Gaussian Elimination instead of the old recursive
      decomposition algorithm, to allow for solving "complex" recipe systems.
      This also significantly improves performance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.8
Date: 2021.12.30
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash triggered by the removal of mods that add new crafting categories to the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.7
Date: 2021.11.30
  Bugfixes:
    - Empty input textfields in the calculator's sheets will no longer trigger an
      "Invalid production rate" error on (re)calculation. They will just be interpreted as
      production rates of zero.
  Changes:
    - Default module counts are now set to 1 instead of 0.
    - Byproducts in reports no longer have a choose-recipe-button in their row, since it is
      redundant in that case anyway.
  Locale:
    - Added Czech and Romanian localizations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2021.11.25
  Minor Features:
    - The time unit for the target production rates can now be chosen between "/m" and "/s"
      using a drop-down to the right of the production rate textfield, which replaces the previous
      "/m" static label.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
Date: 2021.11.22
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash caused by the on_player_removed event handler. Moreover, the handler should now
      do the proper cleanup whenever a player is removed from the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2021.11.19
  Changes:
    - Numbers shown in the report now use a fixed decimal precision instead of the default
      behavior of displaying all the representable decimal digits of the number, except for
      trailing zeroes (which caused really long and ugly numbers to be shown in many cases,
      especially when using modules). Precision is set to 3 by default, but it can be set between 1
      and 6 inclusive in the Mod Settings. The setting is per save.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2021.11.14
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash related to items/fluids that had production rates of zero, usually caused by
      "barreling" and "un-barreling" recipes. Entries with production rates of zero will be
      eliminated from now on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2021.10.21
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash triggered by recipes which can only be crafted manually.
  Locale:
    - Added a label for recipes which can only be crafted manually.
    - Changed the label "Undecomposable" to "Not decomposable".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2021.10.18
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed the infinite recursion crash that occurred with some recipes of some
      overhaul mods, by no longer allowing the Decomposer to enter cycles.
  Minor Features:
    - Recipes with the allow_decomposition property set to false can now be used by the mod too.
  Locale:
    - Added a tooltip to the choose_recipe_button to better inform the player about how the recipe
      can be unselected. This replaces the default tooltip (which displays the recipe itself).
  Changes:
    - Removed the keybind for "completely" resetting the calculator (CTRL + ALT + C by default),
      because it was only useful for debugging and it's not needed anymore.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
